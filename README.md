## Support

If you need any help with this, please contact us at [support.cms-content-sync.io](https://support.cms-content-sync.io/).

## Content Sync

[Content Sync](https://cms-content-sync.io/) allows you to share content and media between multiple Drupal websites. You can use it to prepare your content on a private staging instance and then push it to your production environment by the click of a button. Or you can use it to connect any number of Drupal sites and share content between them.
Distribute your content automatically to all connected sites or provide your editors a simple interface for importing content and media by the click of a button- itâ€™s all in your hands.

## Sync Core

This repository documents the setup of the Sync Core for local and on-premise installations.
The full documentation is available [here](https://edgebox.github.io/sync-core-on-premise/).
